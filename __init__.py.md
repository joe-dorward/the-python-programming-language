**[DISCLAIMER]** I am *NOT* sure that any of the following is *CORRECT* - but it works for me.

On my computer, that path to my 'parent' Python folder is:
```Console
C:\Users\Joe\Documents\My Programming\Python
```

Below my 'parent' Python folder, is a `packages` folder, where I have decided to start
adding generically useful methods - this is how that folder (a time of writing) looks.
