Continuing the exploration of using Tkinter with Python *Dictionaries*,
this version demonstrates how analyse a dictionary with a recursive function.

The application has a few hard-coded dictionaries, progressively more complex,
from `books_empty`, to `books_4` to demonstrate how the application can handle
Python dictionaries of 'unknown' depth.

**books_empty**
```Python
books_empty = {}
```
When `books_empty` is processed, the application reports its analisis to the console. 
```Python
Analysing 'books_empty'

 The dictionary is empty
```



, keys and (whether or not) they are dictionaries are printed to the console.
