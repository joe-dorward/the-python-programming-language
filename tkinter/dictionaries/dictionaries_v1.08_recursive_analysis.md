Continuing the exploration of using Tkinter with Python *Dictionaries*,
this version demonstrates how to analyse a dictionary with a recursive function.

The application has a few hard-coded dictionaries, progressively more complex,
from `books_empty` to `books_4`, to demonstrate how the application can handle
Python dictionaries of 'unknown' depth.

When the `Analyse` > `books_empty` option is selected, the application prints
its analysis to the console.

```Python
Analysing 'books_empty'

 The dictionary is empty
