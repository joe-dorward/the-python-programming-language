Continuing the exploration of using Tkinter with Python, this version
begins the exploration of using Python *Dictionaries* for storing and
processing data.

In Python, *Dictionaries* are generally referred to as being 
"*lists of key value pairs*", with the first-item of the pair being the
**key**, and the second-item of the pair being the **value**.

In any dictionary, the keys *MUST BE* unique, but the values *CAN BE*
duplicates (or more).

In this version, the *Dictionary* is hard-coded. In it, the keys
are unique, but there is a duplicate value.

```Python
compact_disk_dictionary = {
    'Flesh & Blood':'Roxy Music',
    'Hunky Dory':'David Bowie',
    'Rio':'Duran Duran',
    'Avalon':'Roxy Music'
}
```
