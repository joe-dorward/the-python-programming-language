Several years ago, I took on the task to to research and develop *RackBuilder*
– a drag-and-drop DHTML web-application.
The web-application would read an 'XML Sales Order' (a component list) and draw
a data-centre rack layout based on positional information in the XML. 
The user interface would allow drag-and-drop repositioning – and ‘on save’ – 
it would update the 'XML Sales Order'.
The updated 'XML Sales Order' would then be 'read' by VISIO - VBA to create a
VISIO illustration of the rack layout for use by installation engineers in
customer data centres.
