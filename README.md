## Getting Started With Python

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">**Python**</a><img src="../../illustrations/external_link.png" />
is a widely-used, high-level, programming language.

## Pre-requisites
* Download and install Python from - <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note** Older computers will require the installation of older versions. The installers are 'intelligent', when you run them, they will refuse to install 'too new' versions of Python on 'too old' operating system versions. I have Python 3.8.9 running on Windows 8.

* Download and install VS (Visual Studio) Code from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note** Older computers will require the installation of older versions. You will have to deduce which version to install. I have VS Code 1.79.2 running on Windows 8.

* Run VS Code
* Add the Python extension
